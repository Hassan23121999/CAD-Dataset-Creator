# CAD-Dataset-Creator

This repository hosts a Python project aimed at simplifying the process of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model creation. Utilizing the `cadquery` library, the project enables the generation of basic geometric shapes such as boxes, cylinders, hexagons, and spheres. The project is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for random dimension generation as well as user-defined specifications.

## Features

- **Shape Generation:** Easily create various CAD shapes with specified or random dimensions.
- **Export Capabilities:** Models can be exported in both STEP and STL formats, catering to diverse CAD applications.
- **User Interaction:** Utilizes `tkinter` for simple dialogues and file selection, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Data Recording:** Dimensions and shape types are recorded in an Excel spreadsheet, aiding in the organization and documentation of generated models.

## Ideal for

- Educators and students in engineering or design fields looking for a straightforward tool to generate simple 3D models.
- Hobbyists or professionals in need of quick mock-ups or placeholders for more complex CAD projects.
- Software developers exploring CAD model generation through scripting.
